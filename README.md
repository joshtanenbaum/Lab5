need to click note 2x (click note, go back to home pg, click the same note again) to get it to display in /post/:postID need to refresh to see most changes
I struggled to find the right mongoose function/format to update the db, but I eventually found it.

Screencap1 (home pg)
![Alt text](screencap1.png?raw=true)

Screencap2 (update note pg)
![Alt text](screencap2.png?raw=true)

Screencap3 (new note pg)
![Alt text](screencap3.png?raw=true)
